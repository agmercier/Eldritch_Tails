West of the city the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever <color=\#FF0000>cut</color> and no sunlight reaches through. Thin brooks run through it in the darkness, the water blackened with mud. #background:woods #voice:dl
The water splashes up and leaves black stains on his skin and clothes as NPC's running footsteps disturb it. Even though the stream is only small, the resistance is powerful. The water is pulling him down, slowing him down and seems to whisper "don't leave, don't leave..." #background:woods 
NPC wriggles himself from its grip and continues running. He has to get out! Navigating through the dark trees becomes harder and harder, as the forest gets more dense and the branches seem to be closing in on him, gripping onto his clothes and hair and making him trip. They hook into his skin and lock him in a horrible embrace he can't escape from. He screams, but the only audible sound is the ever present wind rustling through the leaves, as if the forest is laughing at him. #background: woods #left: NPC (temporary)

He wakes up with the sound still echoing in his ears and drenched in sweat. Bewildered, he sits up and sees his wife still peacefully asleep lying next to him. #background: inside #left: NPC (temporary)
Another nightmare, then...
He carefully gets off the bed and looks out the window, into the dark forest. It should be around sunrise, but because NPC and his family live on the outskirts of the village, right next to the forest, it is always dark. #background: woods

Later that day, he makes his way into the village. He's out of food, but it seems the village crops are not in abundance this year. There are only a few carrots, pale and weirdly shaped, and lettuce, half eaten by maggots and other vermin, on display at the food stall. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary)
Plower: "Now, don't look so disappointing. I tried to save what I could, otherwise we would have nothing." #background: village #right: plower #left: NPC (temporary)
He crosses his arms, which are covered in dirt, showing he clearly harvested the field only this morning. "When the well is completed and we have fresh water again, I'm telling you it will be better!" #background: village #right: plower #left: NPC (temporary)
In the old days, the village had had a well as well for their water supply, but it has long since fallen to ruins and for now, the village is dependent on the muddy creeks for their water supply. However, recently the villagers started on the project to rebuild the old thing. It is tedious work, but it finally seems like it's getting closer to completion. #background: village
Plower: "Speaking of it, I heard you want to leave the village", he continues. A hint of displeasure leaks through his casual demeanor. #background: village #right: plower #left: NPC (temporary)

NPC nods. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: plower
Plower: "Well, what ever for? We have everything we need in this community, no? And everyone's a vital pillar for it as well. That's truly a happy place, isn't it?" he says and smiles. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: plower
NPC: "Yeah, I guess", NPC complies, but in his head the desire to leave only grows stronger. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: plower
A proper school for his kid and ample new opportunities for his wife and himself. Compared to that, the redundant life in the village sounds slightly oppressive. Yes, they will seek their chance elsewhere. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary)

NPC: "Ofcourse, I will get to it", NPC replies. Taking on jobs for his fellow villagers will be a great way to earn money, which he will surely need if he is to leave this place. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: plower
Plower: "Great. The crates are near the vegetable bed. Thank you!" #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: plower
NPC makes his way to the vegetable bed. It is small and at present it mostly consists of dried earth with barely any vegetables growing. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
"NPC?" #background: village
He turns around at hearing his name and sees another villager. She clearly just returned from the hunt, as a bow is slung around her shoulder and she's holding a handful of freshly killed birds and rabbits. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
NPC: "Hello Jennifer." #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
Jennifer: She smiles. "The field doesn't bring us much these days, but the woods are prosperous and provide us with all we need. It would be a shame to leave such a place behind. Right?" #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
NPC: "Surely." #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
She sits down and grabs her knife, starting to skillfully remove the skin and innards of the first catch. The blood drips down into a bucket by her side, the steady sound cutting through the silence after his response. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
Drip. Drip. Drip. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
She looks up at NPC and smiles again, but her eyes look cold.  #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
Jennifer: "Let's all remain happy here." With a sharp sound, she cuts off the head of the pheasant in one fell swoop. It lands at her feet and the glazy, hollow eyes seem to stare at NPC. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
He can't help but feel uneasy. Why do all the other villagers seem so opposed to him leaving? #background: village #left: NPC (temporary)

He stoops down next to the crates to look at them more closely. Indeed, they appear to be old, the wood is rotting in some places. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
Suddenly, he sees something moving from the corner of his eye. He turns to look.. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
In the vegetable bed next to him, the earth in some places is moving, like something is moving underneath. The lettuce was eaten by vermin, so maybe it's rats? Still, it is best to know for sure. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
NPC leans over the vegetable bed and reaches for the place where the soil is moving, ready to expose what's beneath it. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
As soon as he does so, a withered hand emerges from the ground and locks his wrist in a tight grip. NPC yells out in surprise, but the hunter is already gone again and there's no one to see what's going on. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
The hand is immensely strong and NPC can't do anything as it slowly pulls his arm into the ground. With his other hand, NPC tries to stop it, but the dry earth forms little resistance and he sinks deeper into it. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
What is going on?! #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
He screams for help until his mouth starts filling with earth and his yells are muffled. Before long, his eyes were submerged as well and he was completely dragged into the ground. #background: village

NPC: "I'm sorry, I have other engagements." #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: hunter
A few houses further, a villager is repairing her roof, her two children eagerly helping. The eldest child is standing on the ladder, while the youngest is holding it in place. #background: village
Then, the youngest gets distracted by a grasshopper, letting go of the ladder, the little child chases after it. Immediately, the ladder starts wobbling. The older child loses balance and falls to the ground. #background: village

Huh? Is the village leader not acting rather strange? He's saying the exact same thing again, like a broken record or a rehersed response. How odd. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) #right: leader

A few hours have passed and NPC decides to try talking to the leader again. The strangeness of their previous encounter is starting to leave his mind. The leader simply is just a very enthousiastic man, so that's why he was just happy about all the places they talked about. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary) 
He knocks again. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary)

"Here, we'll show you", the other one says and NPC follows them back into the forest.
The creek is not far from the village and soon they reach its beds. Like they said, the water stands high and a strong current rushes through it. Clearly, it would be dangerous to try to cross it, so going west is impossible for now. #background: woods #right: hunter #center: hunter #left: NPC (temporary)

So going west seems impossible now. A shame, NPC thinks, since he knows a town should not be too far that way. #background: woods #left: NPC (temporary)

Suddenly a loud creaking sound disturbs the singing of birds in the forest and a large tree comes falling down, blocking the road before him. #background: woods #left: NPC (temporary)
What is this?! #background: woods #left: NPC (temporary)
Being a lumberjack, NPC is fairly knowledgable on trees. Surely, he would have noticed if such an unsteady tree had been standing so close to the village? 
He sighs and walks closer. It's a big oak and will probably take days to clean up, which means this road is out of order for now too. #background: woods #left: NPC (temporary)

He tries to shrug off the weird events of the day and sets his mind on his goal; leaving this village. He grabs his cart and makes up a list of supplies they need to create the life they want, one by one gathering all the things. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary)

He knows it is all worth it to see the smiles on his families faces when they can finally set out to start a better life. #background: village #left: NPC (temporary)
A smile is not what greets him as he steps foot over the door treshold. A silence almost pressing in its urgency, followed by the sight of his daughter in bed. Sick with fever. #background: inside #right: daughter

His experience with the woods and their layout was what gave NPC hope. He knew he had seen a clustering of white willow trees, somewhere, at some point... Their bark could be used tobrew a tea to reduce fever. Searching ferferently he combed the woods, but to no avail. Having combed the part of the woods he frequented there were only to options left.
