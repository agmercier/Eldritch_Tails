West of the city the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever <color=\#FF0000>cut</color> and no sunlight reaches through. Thin brooks run through it in the darkness, the water blackened with mud. #background:forest blank  #voice:dl
The water splashes up and leaves black stains on his skin and clothes as {NPC_Name}'s running footsteps disturb it. Even though the stream is only small, the resistance is powerful. The water is pulling him down, slowing him down and seems to whisper "don't leave, don't leave..." #background:forest blank 
{NPC_Name} wriggles himself from its grip and continues running. He has to get out! Navigating through the dark trees becomes harder and harder, as the forest gets more dense and the branches seem to be closing in on him, gripping onto his clothes and hair and making him trip. They hook into his skin and lock him in a horrible embrace he can't escape from. He screams, but the only audible sound is the ever present wind rustling through the leaves, as if the forest is laughing at him. #background: forest blank #left: NPC

He wakes up with the sound still echoing in his ears and drenched in sweat. Bewildered, he sits up and sees his wife still peacefully asleep lying next to him. #background: inside 1 #left: NPC 
Another nightmare, then...
He carefully gets off the bed and looks out the window, into the dark forest. It should be around sunrise, but because {NPC_Name} and his family live on the outskirts of the village, right next to the forest, it is always dark.

She looks at his pale, startled face.

{NPC_Name} turns to step back into his bed, when he steps into something liquid on the ground. #background: inside blank #left: NPC

When did that happen? Yesterday evening the glass had just been standing there and surely he would have heard it falling?

He crosses his arms, which are covered in dirt, showing he clearly harvested the field only this morning. 
Plower: "When the well is completed and we have fresh water again, I'm telling you it will be better!" 
In the old days, the village had had a well as well for their water supply, but it has long since fallen to ruins and for now, the village is dependent on the muddy creeks for their water supply. However, recently the villagers started on the project to rebuild the old thing. It is tedious work, but it finally seems like it's getting closer to completion. 
Plower: "Speaking of it, I heard you want to leave the village", he continues. A hint of displeasure leaks through his casual demeanor. #right: plower #left: NPC

{NPC_Name}: "Yeah, I guess", {NPC_Name} complies, but in his head the desire to leave only grows stronger. 
A proper school for his kid and ample new opportunities for his wife and himself. Compared to that, the redundant life in the village sounds slightly oppressive. Yes, they will seek their chance elsewhere.

He turns around at hearing his name and sees another villager. She clearly just returned from the hunt, as a bow is slung around her shoulder and she's holding a handful of freshly killed birds and rabbits. #background: village blank #left: NPC #right: Jennifer
{NPC_Name}: "Hello Jennifer." 
Jennifer: "The field doesn't bring us much these days, but the woods are prosperous and provide us with all we need. It would be a shame to leave such a place behind. Right?" 
{NPC_Name}: "Surely." 
She sits down and grabs her knife, starting to skillfully remove the skin and innards of the first catch. The blood drips down into a bucket by her side, the steady sound cutting through the silence after his response. 
Drip. Drip. Drip. 
She looks up at {NPC_Name} and smiles again, but her eyes look cold.  
Jennifer: "Let's all remain happy here." With a sharp sound, she cuts off the head of the pheasant in one fell swoop. It lands at her feet and the glazy, hollow eyes seem to stare at {NPC_Name}.

In the vegetable bed next to him, the earth in some places is moving, like something is moving underneath. The lettuce was eaten by vermin, so maybe it's rats? Still, it is best to know for sure. 
{NPC_Name} leans over the vegetable bed and reaches for the place where the soil is moving, ready to expose what's beneath it. 
As soon as he does so, a withered hand emerges from the ground and locks his wrist in a tight grip. {NPC_Name} yells out in shock, but the hunter is already gone again and there's no one to see what's going on. 
The hand is immensely strong and {NPC_Name} can't do anything as it slowly pulls his arm into the ground.

As he shifts around the sand struggeling desperately, he can see himself. staring back.

Again, he swings the axe with as much force as he can. Still, the tree doesn't budge or break.

Stepping foot into his abode {NPC_Name} luckily saw the doctor standing there. {GetHerbs: He quickly handed the willow bark over to his wife so she could start brewing the medicinal tea. However, before she could start the doctor stopped her.}The man told him that it was likely due to the poluted water that his daughter got sick. {GetHerbs: To brew the tea properly the water would need to be clean.}The new well should be done by now. It will provide fresh water and hopefully make sure she gets better. #background: inside blank #left: NPC #right: doctor #center: wife

Making the journey back again all the way to the village was tiring and {NPC_Name} started thinking about how lucky he was that the well was done now. Although. The well didn't seem done when he passed by it just earlier this morning. #background: village blank #left: NPC

???: Good job for making it this far, we've done the tutorial. Well, almost. First we need to make sure there is actually a well for our dear {NPC_Name}. Right now that file is turned off and we can't actually continue the story. To continue it really is simple. Just go to the game file, find the folder labeled "well", open it, and change it to "on" easy as that. Chop Chop, get to it. We don't have all day. Just make sure you have changed the file before you click to continue.#background: village blank

Something fishy was going on here. The well could never have been completed in such a short time, the strange coincedences and not to speak of how strange the villagers were acting. He was going to find out what was going on and he was going to find out NOW. marching up to the leaders house he banged on the door. #background: leader house blank #left: NPC
Leader: "Good day! What can I help you with today?" #background: leader house blank #left: NPC #right: leader
{NPC_Name}: "Again? You keep saying that! I want answers about what is going on here!" 
The leader seemed taken aback a bit at his brusk manners but the shook his head and seemed to reset himself. 
Leader: "Answers? what do you mean? Are you quite alright? If your not well you shouldn't be up and about working yourself into such a state. You're certainly not in a state to travel" 
{NPC_Name} narrowed his eyes at the man and scoffed. 
{NPC_Name}: "So that's what this is all about then? Everyone is keeping us from leaving. Well! I am taking my family and going! I am sure the bigger city will have better medicine for my daughter anyway!" 
He turned on his heel and walked of. The leader watching him with narrowed eyes.

{NPC_Name}, opening the door to his house, was intercepted by the doctor. #background: house blank #left: NPC #right: doctor
Doctor: "I am afraid your daughter is not well enough to travel." 
{NPC_Name}, hesitantly: "How did you know I was planning on leaving right now?" 
At that point his wife looked up hearing the commotion. #background: house blank #left: NPC #right: doctor #center: wife
Wife: "I am afraid our daughter is not well enough to travell, dear." 
Daughter: "I am afraid I am not well enough to travell, father." #background: house blank #left: NPC #right: daughter #center: wife
Realizing that something was very wrong, not only with the town but also his own family. {NPC_Name} turned heel and ran into the forest. He was going to get out of here! No matter what. #background: house blank #left: NPC

===ForestStay===
He ran on deeper and deeper into the forest. The trees grew more dense, blocking out more of the sunlight and it seemed to grow darker with every step. He still pushed on. Just about as he was to cross the treshold of the part of the forest that he knew, he realized that he was running, but he was not moving. Panicked he pushed even harder, even further, but no matter what he stayed in the same place. #background: dark forest blank #left: NPC
Daughter: "Come on dad, your not just gonna leave us behind are you?" #background: dark forest blank #left: NPC #right: daughter
Turning around he saw his daughter. Standing, completely fine. But it wasn't his daughter. None of this was right. In a fit of desperation he turned around and ran at her. Almost when he had reached her, he seemed to trip on nothing. and fall.
